Visit my store in Corvallis and be prepared to be taken to another world.  My first greeter is a 12 inch tall version of Robby the Robot,
from the 1956 science fiction movie "Forbidden Planet".  He talks, he moves, he's cute as a button.

Starting with four 3D printers for: metal, plastic, wood and glass.  6.5 feet wide inkjet banner printing on photo paper, fabric and vinyl
rolls.  With the vinyl printer I can print car and truck wraps, for advertising, or just for fun.

I can even print your house.  No kidding.

The retail section of the store will be filled with my own 3D designs and samples from millions of CAD drawings available online
for free.

There's even one of Robby the Robot.  Looking forward to feeding various printers for glass, plastic and metal parts.

No hard sales, here.  Either you like it and want it or you don't.  You want to return something a year down the road, I'll take it
back for a full refund.  If I made it, you couldn't have gotten it anywhere else.

We take cash, checks, credit and debit cards and will convert foreign currency minus 2% of the going rate.  Nobody else does that.

Feel free to pick up 3D creations and play with them.  If your kid drops one and breaks it, so what?  I can print another one in
30 minutes.  I'm serious.  Come on in and join the fun!
